# spring-boot-problem-demo
Demo for https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/11814

Though i spend serveral hours to debug the code, i didn't find something really useful.   
I stop writing 'Person Understanding' in the issue because i found the class's    
javadoc has already claimed those things.    
And I feel my English is not good-_-   
Feel happy to see that it's really a problem.
